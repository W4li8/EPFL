% The robot arm is modeled with the following state space representation:
% - X: state vector = 4 joint angles of the robot arm
% - U(1:4): input vector = 4 joint speed
% - U(5): final time of the trajectory (constant for all timesteps), at 
% which the robot arm should reach a specified target

%% OVERWRITE COST VARIABLE IN EACH FUNCTION %%

% Task 1: Minimum time 
% This function minimizes the time scaling parameter Tf to minimize
% trajectory time
function cost = minimumTime(X, U, e, data, robot, target)

    cost = 0;
end


% Task 2: Minimum distance in task space 
% This function integrates dx = J*dq to minimize Cartesian trajectory length
% You can obtain the Jacobian J at configuration q using
% J = robot.fastJacobian(q)
% USE THE SQUARE OF THE NORM FOR NUMERICAL STABILITY
function cost = minimumTaskDistance(X, U, e, data, robot, target)

    cost = 0;
    for i = 1:data.PredictionHorizon
        J0 = robot.fastJacobian(X(i,:));
        J1 = robot.fastJacobian(X(i+1,:));
        cost = cost + norm(J1*X(i+1,:)' - J0*X(i,:)')^2;
    end
end


% Task 3: Minimum distance in joint space 
% This function integrates dq to minimize joint trajectory length
% USE THE SQUARE OF THE NORM FOR NUMERICAL STABILITY
function cost = minimumJointDistance(X, U, e, data, robot, target)

    cost = 0;
    for i = 1:data.PredictionHorizon
        cost = cost + norm(X(i+1,:) - X(i,:))^2;
    end
