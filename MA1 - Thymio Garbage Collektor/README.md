The story associated to the project is that we want our Thymio to go pick up a bag of garbage (the green object) and get it to the bin (yellow post-it) all while avoiding the houses (black global obstacles) and cars (local white obstacles). This is done in unfavourable snowy conditions where the camera can momentarily get obstructed by heavy snow falls, the surface is particularly slippery at times, rooftops are painted with a chemical coating that prevents snow from accumulating and causing dangerous snow falls (so they stay black), all cars are covered in snow (so they're all white) and can't be detected by the camera, and finally, everyone is at home opening their Christmas gifts as it's too cold outside to play anyway ☃️🎁🎄.
